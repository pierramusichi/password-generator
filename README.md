# Python-based Password Generator

## Overview

A simple Python tool to generate strong, random passwords. Customize the password length and receive a secure combination of letters, digits, and special characters.

## Features

- **Customizable Length**: Specify password length.
- **Randomized Characters**: Includes letters, digits, and special symbols.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple graphical interface for quick generation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierramusichi/password-generator.git
cd password-generator
python password_generator.py
```

## Usage

Run the script and enter the desired password length to generate a password.

## Skills Developed

### 1. Python Programming
Gained a deeper understanding of Python’s syntax, including control structures, functions, and libraries.
Utilized libraries such as random for generating random characters and string for character sets, enhancing knowledge of Python’s standard library.

### 2. Algorithm Design
Randomization: Implemented algorithms to create secure and unpredictable passwords.
Efficiency: Developed methods to balance randomness with computational efficiency.

### 3. Security Awareness:
Integrated security principles such as using a strong randomization approach to ensure the passwords are robust and difficult to guess.
